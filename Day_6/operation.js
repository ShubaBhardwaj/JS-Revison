let str1 = "Hello"
let str2 = " World"
let str3 = str1 + str2

console.log("Addition of two strings...",str3);

console.log("1"+2);
console.log(1+2+"2");

// In this "console.log("1"+2+2)" condition string comes first so addition will be done as string concatenation 
// In this "console.log(1+2+"2")" condition number comes first so addition will be done as number and then string concatenation
